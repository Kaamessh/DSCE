# 🌾 AI-Driven Food Supply–Demand Predictor  
### Reducing Market Waste • Stabilizing Prices • Empowering Farmers

---

##  Project Overview

Agricultural markets often suffer from **supply–demand imbalance**, leading to:

- -> Overproduction  
- -> Price crashes or spikes  
- -> Post-harvest losses  
- -> Farmer income instability  

This project presents an **AI-powered decision-support system** that predicts **future supply, demand, and price trends** using historical market data and contextual factors — and then **advises whether planting a crop is recommended or not**.

🎯 **Key idea:**  
> Farmers should not enter prices or quantities they don’t know — the system predicts them.

##  What Makes This Project Different?

-> Not just prediction — **decision intelligence**  
-> Simple inputs, powerful outputs  
-> Built for **real farmers & market planners**  
-> Explainable and extensible (chatbot-ready)

## ** Problem Statement

> Agricultural markets frequently experience mismatches between food supply and consumer demand, resulting in food wastage, price volatility, and income loss for farmers.

**Goal:**  
Build an AI system that:
- Predicts **future supply, demand, and prices**
- Detects **market surplus or shortage**
- Recommends **whether to plant a crop or not**
- Helps reduce **food waste and risk**
